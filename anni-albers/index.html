    <h1>Designing as Visual Organization</h1>

	<p>It is safe, I suppose, to assume that today most if not all of us have had the experience of looking down from an airplane onto this earth. What we see is a free</p>
    <p>flow of forms intersected here and there by straight lines, rectangles, circles, and evenly drawn curves; that is, by shapes of great regularity. Here we have, then,</p>
    <p>natural and man-made forms in contradistinction. And here before us we can recognize the essence of designing a visually comprehensible, simplified</p>
    <p>organization of forms that is distinct from nature's secretive and complex working.</p>

    <p>Or on a beach, we may find a button, a bottle, a plank of wood, immediately recognizable as "our" doing, belonging to our world of forms and not to that which</p>
    <p>made the shells, the seaweed, and the undulated tracings of waves on sand. Also we can observe the counterplay of the forming forces: the sea slowly grinding</p>
    <p>an evenly walled piece of glass, foreign to it in shape and substance, into a multiform body suitable for adoption into its own orbit of figuration. On the other</p>
    <p>hand, we see the waves controlled, where dams and dikes draw a rigid line between land and water.</p>

    <p>To turn from "looking at" to action: we grow cabbages in straight rows and are not tempted by nature's fanciful way of planting to scatter them freely about. We</p>
    <p>may argue that sometimes we follow her method and plant a bush here and another there, but even then we "clear" the ground. Always, though sometimes in a</p>
    <p>way that is roundabout and apparent only as an underlying scheme of composition, it is clarity that we seek. But when the matter of usefulness is involved, we</p>
    <p>plainly and without qualification use our characteristics: forms that, however far they may deviate in their final development, are intrinsically geometric.</p>

    <p>If, then, it appears that our stamp is or should be an immediate or implicit lucidity, a considered position, a reduction to the comprehensible by reason or</p>
    <p>intuition in whatever we touch (confusion always gets a negative rating), we have established a basis for designing - designing in any field. From city-planning</p>
    <p>to the planning of a house or road, from the composing of music to the formulation of a law, the weaving of a fabric, or the painting of a picture - behind the</p>
    <p>endless list of things shaped is a work of clarification, of controlled formulation.</p>

    <p>By using the term "designing" for all these varied ways of pre-establishing form, we are, of course, doing some violence to the word. "Designing" usually means</p>
    <p>"giving shape to a useful object." We do not speak of designing a picture or a concerto, but of designing a house, a city, a bowl, a fabric. But surely these can all</p>
    <p>be, like a painting or music, works of art. Usefulness does not prevent a thing, anything, from being art. We must conclude, then, that it is the thoughtfulness</p>
    <p>and care and sensitivity in regard to form that makes a house turn into art, and that it is this degree of thoughtfulness, care, and sensitivity that we should try</p>
    <p>to attain. Culture, surely, is measured by art, which sets the standard of quality toward which broad production slowly moves or should move.</p>
