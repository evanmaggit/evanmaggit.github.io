	<h2>What are the differences between presenting an image using an HTML tag (like <img>) and presenting it as the background of an HTML element (using the CSS property background-image)?</h2>

    <p>In design terms: an "<img>"" is similar to an actor on stage, which is "a part of the story". A "background-image" is more like the set design, which is "important for the mood, but not the dialogue".</p>

    <p>"<img>" is mainly for the content. It represents an image that’s part of the page’s meaning. "background-image" is decoration. It’s meant for visual styling like textures, gradients, or certain visuals.</p>

    <h2>Besides background-image, what other CSS properties affect the display of background images?</h2>

    <h3>1. background-size</h3>
    
    <p>This property controls how the image scales within its section.</p>

    <textarea>

        background-size: cover;
        background-size: contain;
        background-size: 100% 50%;

    </textarea>

    <h3>2. background-position</h3>

    <p>This defines where the image sits inside of its element.</p>

    <textarea>

        background-position: center center;
        background-position: top right;
        background-position: 20px 50%;

    </textarea>

    <h2>In one sentence, how would you define the differences between dimensions and resolution in a bitmap image?</h2>

    <p>"Dimensions" refer to the width and height of an image in pixels, while "resolution" refers to the density of the pixels packed into how the image is displayed or printed (also known as PPI).</p>
