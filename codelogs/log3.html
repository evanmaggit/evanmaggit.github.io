	<h1>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</h1>

    <p>A CSS media query is like a statement full of conditions for a webpage’s style.</p>

    <p>Media queries are the backbone of responsive design, which means your site can adapt to different devices like desktops, tablets, and phones without you having to build separate versions.</p>

    <h2>What "media features" are supported by media queries — such as "orientation" or "max-width" — and what do they do?</h2>

    <p>Firstly, "max-width" checks if the browser's width is less than or equal to a certain size.</p>

    <p>Secondly, "orientation" tests if a device is in portrait mode or landscape mode.</p>

    <p>Thirdly, "resolution" shows the pixel density of the device, which is measured in DPI (dots per inch).</p>

    <p>Lastly, "prefers-color-scheme" detects if someone is using dark more or light mode.</p>
