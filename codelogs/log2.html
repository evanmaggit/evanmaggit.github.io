	<h1>What is the difference between absolute and relative CSS length units?</h1>

    <p>Absolute units are fixed, physical sizes that don't scale with the user's screen or settings. For example: A 20px font will always be 20 pixels, no matter the parent element or viewport size.</p>

    <p>Relative units are scaled in relation to something else (like parent element, root font size, or viewport). For example: A 2em font will be twice the parent's font size, so it changes dynamically depending on context.</p>

    <h2>Below are three example of absolute and relative units...</h2>

    <p>"px" is an absolute unit that scales the resolution and zoom level, and "pt" are absolute units intended to represent physical dimensions.</p>

    <p>"%" is a relative unit that expresses size as a proportion of another value, usually the size of a parent element or a containing context.</p>

    <p>"em" is relative to parent font size, and "rem" which is relative to root element.</p>
